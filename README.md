eCommerce Customer Analysis Project

Overview:
This project involves analyzing an eCommerce transactions dataset to derive actionable business insights, build a lookalike model for customer recommendations, and perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. It is divided into three tasks: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Lookalike Model, and Customer Segmentation/Clustering.

Dataset Description:
The dataset contains three files:
1.Customers.csv
2.Products.csv
3.Transactions.csv

Project Summary:

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted EDA to uncover patterns in customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends. Derived key insights such as top-performing regions, popular products, and seasonal transaction patterns.

Task 2: Lookalike Model
Built a recommendation model using customer profiles and transaction history. For each customer, the model identifies 3 similar customers with similarity scores, enabling personalized marketing strategies.

Task 3: Customer Segmentation
Applied clustering techniques to group customers based on spending habits and profiles. Evaluated clusters using the Davies-Bouldin Index and visualized them to understand distinct customer behaviors for targeted business strategies.

Models Used and Outcomes:

Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Models/Techniques Used: Descriptive statistics, visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line plots, heatmaps).

Outcome:
Identified top regions, product categories, and customer trends.
Highlighted seasonal sales patterns and high-value customers.

Task 2: Lookalike Model
Model Used: Cosine Similarity (for similarity scoring).

Outcome:
Recommended 3 similar customers for each input customer based on transaction and profile data.
Enhanced personalized marketing opportunities with similarity scores for customers C0001 - C0020.

Task 3: Customer Segmentation
Model Used: K-Means Clustering (optimized with Davies-Bouldin Index).

Outcome:
Segmented customers into 4 clusters based on spending patterns and profiles.
Low DB Index (e.g., 0.75) indicated well-defined clusters.
Helped target high-value and at-risk customers effectively.
